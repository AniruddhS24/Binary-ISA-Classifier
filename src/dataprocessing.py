Using the server, we can build our dataset by simply querying for random binary blobs to use as 
training examples. Since we can access the target architecture, we can easily label our dataset.
Moreover, to keep our data balanced with respect to the 12 classes, we generate num_samples examples
from each class, so our total dataset size will be num_samples*12.

'''
Applies tf-idf weighting to arr. Applying tf-idf can
be advantageous as it normalizes our raw counts and also assigns smaller weight 
to common terms, thereby giving rare/special terms more weight. I calculated it
as follows:

tf(t, d) = rawcount(t, d)/sum(rawcount(d))
idf(t) = log(N / df(t))

tfidf(t, d) = tf(t,d) * idf(t)
    
    for term t in document d, and where our corpus has N documents. df(t) represents
    the number of documents which contain at least 1 occurrence of term t. 

For example, in
an NLP setting, a word like "the" is probably not very useful for a text 
classification task because its so common. If we simply use raw counts, our model
will see a large weight assigned to "the" and might treat it as an important word. 
However, the idf term for "the" is probably very low as it most likely appears in almost
all documents, so the tf-idf weight for "the" will be low, as desired. Similarly, we want
to assign higher weight to more rare tokens in our binary blob that can help predict the target
architecture
